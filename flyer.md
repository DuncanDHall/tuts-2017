# Programming Jump Start!

Computer programming is an essential skill today in our world as code is involved in more fields than ever before

Hi! My name is Duncan, I'm a Camden Hills Regional High School graduate and current student at Olin College of Engineering. This summer I'm offering an affordable introduction to programming concepts for students ages 12-18 in the form of one-on-one/small group lessons. 

We'll be covering the basics of Python, one of the most widely applicable and easy to learn languages. For older students topics explored will also include Git version control, Java, and how to set up your development environment for success!
